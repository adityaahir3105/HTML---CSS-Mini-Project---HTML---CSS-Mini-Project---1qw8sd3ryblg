									<h2>Introduction</h2>
									<p>
										Noise pollution can be defined as high level of sounds which can cause ear problems. Which are mainly caused by machines and transportation systems, motor vehicles, aircraft,
										iand trains. Outdoor noise is summarized by the word environmental noise. Urban planning
										iplays a key role because sensitive area like hospital and industrial cannot share same
										ilocality. Noise-induced hearing loss can be caused by outside (e.g. trains) or inside (e.g. music) noise. High noise levels can contribute to cardiovascular effects in humans and an
										iincreased incidence of disease. So, use of sound level meter can help in monitoring sound
										ilevels in various economic zones in urban areas as well as keep a vigilant eye on welfare of
										ipeople in the urban areas. The noise rules laid down by government in year 2000 shows the
										ivalues of dB levels which setup bench mark in controlling the sound levels in urban
										iresidential and industrial areas. This report focuses on review of a system to measure a
										isound level using a meter. It will be useful in controlling the noise levels in urban housing
										iareas to maintain tranquility and peace using by authorities

									</p>
									<p>TYPES OF SOUND LEVEL METER: </p>
									<p>
										There are two kinds of sound measuring instruments, they are integrating sound level meter and
										non-integrating sound level meter. In an integrating-averaging meter, the AC signal from the
										microphone is converted to DC by a root-mean-square circuit the output of the RMS circuit is
										linear voltage and is passed through algorithmic circuit to give a readout in decibels(dB) is one
										that can measure an equivalent continuous Sound level and is required for any proper occupational
										or environmental noise monitoring. Non-integrating meter: A non-integrating meter shows the
										reading for a specific time and are mostly used for short burst of sound which are very specific
										over time length like bullet fire or an artillery round. They are used for research purposes. Different versions of sound level meter are defined because of standards set by International
										Electro technical Commission 61672 which defines the standards for Laboratory use and
										environmental use, SLM are of the two classes, Class1 and Class2, have the same functionality
										but different tolerances for errors. Class 1 instruments have a wider frequency range. ANSI
										specifies SLM as three different types, namely 0, 1 and 2. Type 0, with Type 1 and Type 2
										progressively looser in terms of the tolerances allowed. It is generally easier to make a
										measurement instrument meet wider tolerances and this is usually reflected in the price. Type 1
										instrument is more accurate then type 2 instrument. When the new standard for sound level
										meters, IEC 61672, was developed, Class was replaced by Type. All of the electronic components
										used in a sound level meter such as resistors, capacitors and even microprocessors will have very
										slight differences and these all add up to give each instrument its own variation from the ideal. There are also other factors such as the uncertainty of the measurements made when an instrument
										is being designed or verified. The equipment used to test a sound level meter will itself have some
										level of tolerance and all of these factors add up. At the reference frequency of 1kHz, the tolerance
										limits for Class 1 are +/- 1.1dB and for Class 2 the tolerance is +/- 1.4dB. At the lower and upper
										extremities of the frequency range, the tolerances are wider. At 20Hz, the tolerances are +/-2.5dB
										for Class 1 and +/- 3.5dB for Class 2. At higher frequencies, the same applies. The tolerances for a
										Class 1 instrument are tighter at frequencies above 8kHz with the tolerances at 10kHz being +2.6dB, -3.6dB for Class 1 and +5,6dB, for Class 2. Thus the tolerance is tighter in class 1 then in class 2

									<p>Types of Frequency Weighting for Sound Level Meter:</p>
									<p>
										Frequency Weighting selections will allow the user to obtains reading which provide exact representation to sound pertaining to how a human hears. A, B and Z are the most used weighting
										for sound level meter.
										Human ear perceives 50 Hz to 8 kHz of the frequency range and doesn’t detect high frequency
										which can be said has ultra-high frequencies. In other words, sound levels at certain frequencies
										are boosted or cut (to match how human ear responds to sound level). It was only meant for quiet
										sounds in the region of 40dB sound pressure level
										The most common weighting that is used in noise measurement is A-Weighting. Like the human
										ear, this effectively cuts off the lower and higher frequencies that the average person cannot hear. Frequency weighing C is the type which displays all the range of frequency with equal weighting
										but it is not a human perceives.
										Z-weighted is the flat frequency response of 8Hz to 20kHz (+/- 1.5dB), this is the actual noise that
										is made with no weighting at all for the human ear (Z for zero)
									</p>

									<p>Time Weightings n Digital Sound Level Meters: </p>
									<p>
										Time weighting relates to specifications of the motion of display (including digital reading). There
										are time weighting F (Fast: 125 ms) and time weighting S (Slow: 1 s). Time weighting F is
										approximate to the ears time response. Time weighting S is used to indicate the average level of
										fluctuating noise. Time weighting F is normally used for measuring noise. As loudness of
										impulsive noise cannot be measured accurately using Time weighting F, time weighting I
										(Impulse) (Rise: 35 ms, Fall: 1.5 s) is used for that purpose. In recent studies, however, it has been
										found that I time weighting is not so suitable for evaluating impulsive sound. Currently, it is not
										listed in either IEC (JIS) and is only included in IEC 61672-1:2002. Instead, there has been a
										growing trend towards using peak instantaneous sound pressure as a parameter for evaluating impulsive noise

									<h2>Components:</h2>
									<p>
										Invensense CS-43434 MEMS microphone was selected . This microphone has the
										advantage of offering an I2S fully digital interface, thus reducing the risk of any electrical noise
										on the audio data added somewhere on the signal path on the board between the microphone and For PCB design problem we have corrected pcb design by using smaller pitch connector so basically standard slm have ½ nch microphone

									<img class="img-responsive" src="images/slm4.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
									<h2>Hardware Design</h2>
									<p>Sample the sound via microphone, do some filtering and weighting, calculate noise level n realtime on ESP32 and send the result to main microcontroller. </p>
									<img class="img-responsive" src="images/slm5.jpg" alt="html5 bootstrap template by colorlib.com"><br>
									<p>
										Sampling sound with I2S digital microphone
										The good thing about digital microphones is that you don't need to worry about the analog part like
										pre-amplification, linearity and speed of MCU ADC, etc... And the digital values you receive
										should be already referenced to sound pressure levels (SPL). Datasheet needs to list the amplitude
										value for certain SPL, for 1KHz pure sine wave tone (i.e. -26dBFS @ 94dB SPL). This is usually
										expressed as dBFS  (decibel relative to full-scale), so for i.e. -26dBFS you can convert this to
										absolute amplitude value based on the maximum value mic can send, and in case of 24bit data,
										this should be (2^23 − 1) * 10^(−26/20) ~= 420426. This is the amplitude you should expect to
										receive if you i.e. put the microphone inside 'Sound level calibrator'
